# Tutorial 1: Graph structure

Graph structure plays a critical role in developing a GNN. You may want to visualize the whole graph to roughly understand the sparsity of it and if it has subgraphs of a particular pattern.

GNNLens2 allows you to do it using a simple API with very little effort.

## Data preparation

First we load DGLâ€™s built-in Cora and Citeseer dataset and retrieve their graph structures.

```python
from dgl.data import CoraGraphDataset, CiteseerGraphDataset

cora_dataset = CoraGraphDataset()
cora_graph = cora_dataset[0]
citeseer_dataset = CiteseerGraphDataset()
citeseer_graph = citeseer_dataset[0]
```

Next, we need to dump the graph structures to a local file that GNNLens2 can read. GNNLens2 provides a built-in class `Writer` for this purpose. You can add an arbitrary number of graphs, one at a time. 

Once you finish adding data, you need to call **writer.close()**.

```python
from gnnlens import Writer

# Specify the path to create a new directory for dumping data files.
writer = Writer('tutorial_graph')
writer.add_graph(name='Cora', graph=cora_graph)
writer.add_graph(name='Citeseer', graph=citeseer_graph)
# Finish dumping
writer.close()
```

## Launch GNNLens2

To launch GNNLens2, run the following command line.

```bash
gnnlens --logdir tutorial_graph
```

By entering `localhost:7777` in your web browser address bar, you can see the GNNLens2 interface like below. `7777` is the default port GNNLens2 uses. You can specify an alternative one by adding `--port xxxx` after the command line and change the address in the web browser accordingly.
